# Milk-Dairy-Management-System

Milk Dairy Management System is a web application implemented using React, Node.js, and MySQL.

## Installation and Setup

### Overview

This project consists of three main folders:

- **frontend**: Contains the client-side React application.
- **backend**: Contains the server-side code and APIs.
- **database**: Contains the SQL script for setting up the MySQL database.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (version 14 or later)
- MySQL (for database setup)
- Git (for version control)
- MySQL Workbench (optional, for importing SQL)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**

    Open your terminal or command prompt and run:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Rahulgavane6165/Milk-Dairy-Management-System-.git
    cd Milk-Dairy-Management-System-
    ```

2. **Frontend Setup**

    Navigate to the `frontend` directory and install dependencies:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    ```

    Create a `.env` file based on the `.env.example` provided:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Edit the `.env` file to set the appropriate environment variables.

    Start the frontend development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The frontend will be accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) by default.

3. **Backend Setup**

    Navigate to the `backend` directory and install dependencies:
    ```bash
    cd ../backend
    npm install
    ```

    Create a `.env` file based on the `.env.example` provided:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Edit the `.env` file to configure your database connection and other environment variables.

4. **Database Setup**

    **Import the SQL File Using MySQL Workbench**

    Open MySQL Workbench and connect to your MySQL server.

    **Create a New Database**:
    - Go to the Schemas tab.
    - Right-click on an empty space and select **Create Schema**.
    - Enter a name for your database (e.g., `dairy_2024`) and click **Apply**.

    **Import the SQL File**:
    - Click on the **Server** menu and select **Data Import**.
    - Choose **Import from Self-Contained File** and select the `database/dairy_2024_dump.sql` file from the project directory.
    - Ensure the **Default Schema to be Imported To** is set to the database you created earlier.
    - Click **Start Import** and wait for the process to complete.

    **Configure Database Connection**
    Edit the `backend/.env` file and configure the database connection details. Ensure the `DB_HOST`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, and `DB_NAME` variables match the database you set up.

    **Import the SQL File Using Command Line (Optional)**

    If you prefer using the command line to import the SQL file, you can do so with the following command:
    ```bash
    mysql -u your_username -p your_database_name < database/dairy_2024_dump.sql
    ```
    Replace `your_username` with your MySQL username, and `your_database_name` with the name of the database you created.

5. **Start the Backend Server**

    In the `backend` directory, run:
    ```bash
    node server.js
    ```

6. **Troubleshooting**

    - Ensure that both the frontend and backend servers are running on their respective ports.
    - Verify that the `.env` files are correctly configured.
    - Check the terminal and server logs for any error messages and address them accordingly.
