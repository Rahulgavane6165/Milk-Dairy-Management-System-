Setup Instructions

1.  Clone the Repository
    Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

        git clone https://github.com/Rahulgavane6165/Milk-Dairy-Management-System-.git
        cd Milk-Dairy-Management-System-

2.  Frontend Setup
    Navigate to the frontend directory and install dependencies:
    cd frontend
    npm install

3.  Create a .env file based on the .env.example provided:
    cp .env.example .env
    Edit the .env file to set the appropriate environment variables.

4.  Start the frontend development server:
    npm start
    The frontend will be accessible at http://localhost:3000 by default.

5.  Backend Setup
    Navigate to the backend directory and install dependencies:
    cd ../backend
    npm install

6.  Create a .env file based on the .env.example provided:
    cp .env.example .env
    Edit the .env file to configure your database connection and other environment variables.

7.  Database Setup
    Import the SQL File
    if using terminal : mysql -u [username] -p [database_name] < database/dairy_2024_dump.sql
    Replace [username] with your MySQL username and [database_name] with the name of the database(ex: dai_ry_2024) you want to create.

        Open MySQL Workbench: Launch MySQL Workbench and connect to your MySQL server.

        Create a New Database:

        Go to the Schemas tab.
        Right-click on an empty space and select Create Schema.
        Enter a name for your database (e.g., dairy_2024) and click Apply.
        Import the SQL File: (from databse/dairy_2024_dump.sql)

        Click on the Server menu and select Data Import.
        Choose Import from Self-Contained File and select the database/dairy_2024_dump.sql file from the project directory.
        Ensure the Default Schema to be Imported To is set to the database you created earlier.
        Click Start Import and wait for the process to complete.

        Configure Database Connection
        Edit Backend Configuration: Open the backend/.env file and configure the database connection details. Ensure the DB_HOST, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD, and DB_NAME variables match the database you set up.

8.  Start the Backend Server:
     run: node server.js

9. Troubleshooting
   Ensure that both the frontend and backend servers are running on their respective ports.
   Verify that the .env files are correctly configured.
   Check the terminal and server logs for any error messages and address them accordingly.
